# Sample-Size-Determination-for-Population-Mean-using-Systematic-Sampling
This project focuses on estimating the population mean using systematic sampling. Systematic sampling involves selecting units from an ordered population at regular intervals after a random start.  An R Shiny application is used to demonstrate how sample size selection and survey design are influenced by sampling bias, cost, and time constraints.


**Objectives**

To estimate the required sample size under stratified sampling

To account for sampling bias in survey design

To optimize sample allocation based on cost constraints

To analyze survey time and budget requirements

To visualize the experimental design through plots

**Key Features**

Bias-adjusted MSE-based sample size calculation

Cost-optimal sample allocation across strata

Fixed overhead cost inclusion

Interactive visualization of sample allocation

Resource analysis table (cost and time)

Integrated methodological explanation (white paper tab)

**Technologies Used**

R Programming

R Shiny

ggplot2

dplyr

**How to Run the App**

Install required packages:

install.packages(c("shiny", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))


Run the application:

library(shiny)
